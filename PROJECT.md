### Idea 1 Spot Instances

Leveraging Spot Instance Metrics to save on running test pipelines / dev deployments. I want to monitor spot instances in different regions and aggregate data that would include spot price, node uptime, node termination. I would then use this data to pick which region to run these test pipelines / dev deployments.

### Idea 2 Monitoring

one click monitoring concept utilizing prometheus / elk stack
